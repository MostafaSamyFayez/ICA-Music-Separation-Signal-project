### Independent Component Analysis Lab
In this notebook, we'll use Independent Component Analysis to retrieve original signals from three observations each of which contains a different mix of the original signals. This is the same problem explained in the ICA video.

### Dataset :
is in a wave form 

and here is sample visualization of input wave:
